# Vibing

Vibing is a social "inspiration" website, which is similar to social media platforms, but users only share "good vibes" with others. Users can create, read, update, and delete vibes as well as view inspirational quotes.

## Description

Vibing is a React front end that uses a MongoDB, Express, and Node.js back end that we built for a group project. Users can create, read, update, and delete vibes. Users can sign up for an account, which generates an authentication token. Users can view inspirational quotes to get their creative vibes moving.
