# Vibing

Vibing is a social "inspiration" website, which is similar to social media platforms, but users only share "good vibes" with others. Users can create, read, update, and delete vibes as well as view inspirational quotes.

## Description

Vibing is a React front end that uses a MongoDB, Express, and Node.js back end that we built for a group project. Users can create, read, update, and delete vibes. Users can create an account, which provides an authentication token. Users can view inspirational quotes to get their creative vibes moving.

## Features

We developed a bronze/silver/gold plan, which is available in the planning directory in this repo. We completed all requirements and the bronze-level features of our plan. We also styled the site to display well on small devices (silver plan).

## Usage

<!--
Go to http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/history, which will GET 50 questions in JSON format from the database. See the [API documentation](http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/doc "Pub Quiz API documentation") for the routes to perform CRUD operations in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/ "A collaboration platform for API development."). -->

<!-- Follow the installation instructions below, `cd` to the pub-quiz directory, and run the following commands in the terminal:

- `node db/seed.js`
- `nodemon index.js`
- note: or `node index.js` if you do not have nodemon installed

Then paste http://localhost:3000/history into your favorite browser. Enjoy the JSON data.

Note: for better viewing pleasure, add an extension to your browser that formats JSON data. For example, the JSON Viewer extension in Chrome is lovely. -->

## Installation

<!-- - Clone the repo: https://github.com/ThwCorbin/pub-quiz
- `cd` to the pub-quiz directory
- run `npm i` in the terminal
- note: you will also need to install mongodb globally -->
