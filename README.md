## Usage

<!--
Go to http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/history, which will GET 50 questions in JSON format from the database. See the [API documentation](http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/doc "Pub Quiz API documentation") for the routes to perform CRUD operations in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/ "A collaboration platform for API development."). -->

<!-- Follow the installation instructions below, `cd` to the pub-quiz directory, and run the following commands in the terminal:

- `node db/seed.js`
- `nodemon index.js`
- note: or `node index.js` if you do not have nodemon installed

Then paste http://localhost:3000/history into your favorite browser. Enjoy the JSON data.

Note: for better viewing pleasure, add an extension to your browser that formats JSON data. For example, the JSON Viewer extension in Chrome is lovely. -->
